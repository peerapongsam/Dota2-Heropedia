And in the world of spiteful fairies there are few names spoken of with more contempt than Mireska Sunbreeze.\r\n\r\nBorn to a fae merchant king, Mireska grew up in Revtel; a cutthroat nation where manipulation and murder were the norm. But while she was quite adept at navigating the etiquette, unspoken laws, and social rituals that permeated every element of her life, she found the whole thing rather boring.\r\n\r\nSo, Mireska did what most rebellious children do: burn down her family estate and set off with her pet wisp Jex to live the life of a wandering grifter.",
