In truth, these words are equal parts oath and enforceable covenant, for those who fall short of their duty are banished from the order.  To fail is to be other than Slithereen. \r\n\r\n\t\tOnce most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon.  Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities.  But in the final battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn.  After the long and bloody onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove.  Of her hundred Guard, only a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little consequence.  What mattered was that treasure was taken.  Honor destroyed.  And so Naga Siren was cast out.  Banished to search for the stolen chalice.  Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken.  For no amount of gold is equal in honor to the honor she lost.",
